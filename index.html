            <p>On the 4th day of the 5th month of 2035, a normal night on a normal day seemed to have something amiss. Overnight, all the rose bushes in the world had suddenly grown to enormous heights. With their new growth, they gained a weird toxin which began to spread to the humans of the world. Many people fell victim to the infectious toxin and turned into mutated rose zombies. The few humans that werenâ€™t affected now survive in the wasteland that is Earth, against the ever increasing amount of rose zombies. </p>
